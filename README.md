# A study on the paper ‘Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks’
@author: Lance Zhang
## Phase 1
Analyze and summarize the advantages, disadvantages, applications, and contributions of the paper.<br>
## Phase 2
Pytorch implementation of [Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks].<br>
The test environment: Clemson Palmetto, Python 3.6.0, Jupyter notebook 5.4.0, Pytorch 3.5 and NumPy 1.14. 
```python
cell_type = "LSTM" 
hidden_structs = [20] * 5 
dilations = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16] # 
```
